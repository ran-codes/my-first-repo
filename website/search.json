    "text": "Goals\nThe overarching goal of Quarto is to build bridges across working groups at Dornsife and the UHC by making the process of collaborating on problems and sharing technical expertise dramatically better. We hope to do this in several dimensions:\n\nA automated way for community members to submit issues/requests\nAn accessible website where we can share solutions. Analytic problems are often not unique and solutions may benefit others.\nProvide training for how to collaborative code.\n\nEverything here is open source software licensed under the MIT license. We believe that analytic problems are not unique and it’s better for everyone if the tools, issues and solutions used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science."

    "text": "Project\nThe core technologies that drive this project including:\n\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It allows us to authoer documents as plain text mardkwon or Jupyter notebooks and render high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.\nGitHub is a only developer platform which we utilize to open source our codebase, mangage projects, allow issue submissions, have discussions and host our website. The majority of GitHub features are free for academics.\nTidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. We use these packages and other packages within this ecosystem to do solve problems that involve data management, visualization, dashboards and build packages."
